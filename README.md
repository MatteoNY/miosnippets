## snippets
This is used as an example of work. This project contains a few different programming types of snippets, for example, procedural, jsOOP and functional. 

## Usage:
git clone
Use yarn or npm install to get the files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  

## Results
You should see an ugly page that lists each functions: purpose, function call, function to string and the results that were returned.  

## Notes 
You may get warnings if you're using a different Angular-cli etc. 
This has been built with the Angular-cli and Angular version 4.1.3.
This is a sample of code to answer some of the basics of syntax asked during interviews. 

The snippet lib makes a good place to find for future reference.
I usually create a folder on my local computer but GitHub is an awesome place to keep it.

As far as real-life project this is a small snippet. 
My goals is to apply new insights and functional programming as well as use ES2015+ style of programming in practice. In addition, make use of: Rxjs and (Ngrx)/REDUX on Angular and/or React projects.

Happy programming!
